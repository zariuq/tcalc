/* tcalc: a small kernel for the transform step.

   Terms are hash-consed n-ary nodes; a Term is an index. Each node caches its sort,
   the holes below it, its dependency mask (the bound variables it may mention) and
   whether it contains unknowns.

   State <K ; W>: K binds unknowns (with a trail, for two-way unification) and holds
   disequations; W is the set of occurrences, each a term in a space.

   One rule, fire: take occurrences, keep (read) occurrences, tell equations and
   disequations into K, check the hole sorts and the separation guards, compute the rule's
   sealed operations, check that absent/count queries hold at every solution, check the
   rule's sealed guards, mint a fresh name if asked, make the result.

   Sorts and separation guards come from the binder context a rule is written in:
   a bound hole x must stay apart from every hole that does not depend on x.
   Unknowns (tc_meta) acquire a trailed sort when placed in a sorted constructor
   argument or unified with a sorted term; binding to an incompatible sort is refused.
   A hole of a sort takes a term of that sort: an unknown is not yet one, so a firing
   whose sorted hole would hold an unbound unknown is refused until a tell binds it.

   Extensions: tc_promote checks a proof script once against its context and installs
   it as a rule (SHARE); tc_def adds a defined constructor whose unfolding is checked
   by conversion steps (EXTEND with delta); fresh names are minted by fire.

   The contract after tc_seal (the caller is then untrusted):
   - Only firings (and conversion, active and rho steps) write into a protected static space.
     Dynamic spaces (any other name of the space sort) cannot be protected: callers may post facts
     into them, but not birth markers; only a firing bears a space.
   - Range restriction: a rule that makes into a protected space makes only holes that its take or
     keep patterns bind, that its operations compute, that it mints fresh, or that it declares as
     inputs (Rule.inputs: the holes a caller may supply). tc_rule refuses a rule that makes into a
     space already protected without this; the seal, and tc_protect after it, bar every other such
     rule (tc_rule_barred), and a firing whose computed space is protected checks it at commit. A
     derived rule's inputs are the holes of its conclusion that its hypotheses do not bind.
   - Evidence spaces: after the seal only declared producers can publish into a protected evidence
     space, and a producer makes nothing its caller chose (its input list is empty). The current
     backend is a set of producer rules per space, fixed before the seal (tc_publishers); every
     other rule, every derived rule, and conversion, active and rho steps are refused there.
   - Sealed functions (tc_fn): guards decide a predicate and operations compute words. Both are
     pure, total functions of the words they are given: they read nothing else (not the store, not
     host state) and write only their outputs, keep no state and make no kernel call. Their inputs
     are holes of word sorts bound by matching the current board, or outputs of an earlier
     operation of the same rule; the kernel checks that each input is a word of its sort before the
     call. An operation that returns false has no value and refuses the firing. Its outputs are
     bound by the kernel only (a caller binding of one refuses the firing) and are checked like any
     hole. A firing runs its operations in declaration order after matching, then the absent and
     count queries, then its guards, then makes; neither changes which occurrences matched. A
     function's statement name and contract hash are provenance metadata, never evidence that the
     function computes that statement: registered C stays trusted until a proved native image
     replaces it.
   - Names are minted before they are used: every name a caller supplies (in a posted fact, a tell,
     a rule, a lemma or a hole value) must already be minted, by tc_fresh_name or a fresh firing
     (ids whose top two bits are 01 count as minted), so a fresh name is new to the whole state.
     The names of a word sort are the 64-bit words, literals that need no minting; a fresh hole has
     no word sort.
   - Closed by the seal: tc_rule, tc_fn, tc_publishers, tc_unset, tc_set_quote_con, tc_set_rho_con,
     tc_set_handle_con. Open: tc_sort, tc_con and tc_def (they make new sorts and constructors and
     cannot change one that a sealed rule or a protected fact uses; the HOL checker declares types
     while it replays), tc_protect (it only adds protection), and lemmas (tc_lemma_end, tc_promote:
     derived rules).
   - A firing is atomic: a refusal leaves the store, the bindings, the name counter and the unknown
     counter as they were. The guards a rule declares (absent, count, birth law, its sealed
     operations and guards, and where it may publish) are part of it: tc_eval_prepared_ex checks
     absent, count and birth on every commit into a protected space, whatever its switches, and
     operations, guards and publication in every variant.
   - Custody: the kernel is single threaded and takes no locks. A host gives one thread exclusive
     custody of the whole kernel state for each call, through every commit; concurrent calls are
     outside this contract (no atomic or versioned protocol is provided).
   - Reach (tc_fire_reach, seeds of a prepared step) checks a firing against the spaces reachable
     from the seeds the caller presents; any caller may present any space, so it is a check of the
     caller's intent, not an authority.
   - A conversion, active step or rho step rewrites one occurrence into an equal term: in a store
     with multiplicity (some rule takes or counts, or a located fact exists) it replaces the source,
     as a firing taking it would; in a set store it adds the equal fact.
   - Caps (term depth 4096, reach sets of 512 terms, 1024 search candidates, the 2^27-slot board,
     memory) end in a refusal, never in a wrong result. */
